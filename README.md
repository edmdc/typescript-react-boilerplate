# React Typescript App Boilerplate

A slightly opinionated React app boilerplate. It includes SASS and TypeScript support.

## Abstract

Like most, I created my first react app using the `create-react-app` boilerplate.
Back then, I had no react experience and was thrown off by the extra files and configuration abstractions.
Rather than be satisfied using a tool that I didn't understand, I decided to create my own react boilerplate.
My goal was to learn about react and how it worked as a framework.
However, this journey turned into an exploration of the modern web development environment
created by webpack, babel, other related packages, and their configurations.

## Takeaways

- I got comfortable going into documentation and trying to extract that which
  was meaningful to my learning goals.
- It increased my awareness of how fast JS features, and associated tools, are changing.
- Understanding the core concepts of how project are bundled has allowed me to better understand/apply 
good project architecture practices. It's also allowed me to more quickly adapt to other frameworks that
use similar tools.

### More to Come

- I plan on creating a tutorial walking through the creation of this boilerplate.
- Add a testing environment.
- Create a side branch/repo for Server Side Rendering boilerplate.
